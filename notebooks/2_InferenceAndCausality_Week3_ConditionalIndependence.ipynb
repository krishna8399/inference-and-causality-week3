    "## Conditional Independence in **Chain / Fork / Collider**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we simulate three fundamental causal structures (often called the *building blocks* of causal graphs)  \n",
    "to explore how **conditional independence** behaves in each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder:\n",
    "### Marginal vs Conditional Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marginal correlation** measures how two variables vary together *overall*, without taking any other variables into account.  \n",
    "  → Example: the raw relationship between Smoking and Cancer in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional correlation** measures how two variables relate *after we fix or control for* a third variable.  \n",
    "  → Example: the relationship between Smoking and Cancer **within each level of Tar exposure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:**  \n",
    "If two variables are correlated marginally but not conditionally, it means a third variable (a mediator or confounder) explains their association.  \n",
    "Conversely, if they are independent marginally but correlated conditionally, conditioning has **opened a path** (as in collider bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Chain: A → B → C\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "B, \"the mediator\" transmits information or influence from A to C.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Smoking → Tar in lungs → Cancer.  \n",
    "- A and C are correlated because information “flows” through B.  \n",
    "- **If we condition on B**, we block that path — A and C become (approximately) independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectation:**  \n",
    "- Marginal correlation: high (A and C move together).  \n",
    "- Conditional correlation given B: ≈ 0 (path blocked).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Fork (Confounding): A ← U → C\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "U is a *common cause* (confounder) of both A and C.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Genetic predisposition → Smoking and Cancer.  \n",
    "- A and C appear correlated, but only because of U.  \n",
    "- **If we condition on U**, we remove that shared cause and eliminate the spurious correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectation:**  \n",
    "- Marginal correlation: high (U induces a false link).  \n",
    "- Conditional correlation given U: ≈ 0 (confounding removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Collider: A → B ← C\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "B is a *common effect* (collider) of A and C.  \n",
    "- *Example:*  \n",
    "  - A = Smoking  \n",
    "  - C = Air pollution  \n",
    "  - B = Hospital admission (caused by either).  \n",
    "- Normally, A and C are independent.  \n",
    "- **If we condition on B** (or any descendant of B), we *create* a correlation between A and C —  \n",
    "  this is known as **collider bias** or **selection bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectation:**  \n",
    "- Marginal correlation: near 0 (A, C independent).  \n",
    "- Conditional correlation given B: strong (conditioning opens the path).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "> Correlation alone can mislead: depending on the graph, conditioning can remove, reveal, or even **fabricate** relationships.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Understanding which paths are open or closed (via **d-separation**) is central to causal inference.\n"
